# Twinkly

Twinkly LEDs are magical smart Christmas light bulbs which transform your Christmas tree into something addictive.

I wrote this repo as the Twinkly app has become so unstable it requires often a un/reinstallation which has the awkward effect
that all custom made effects are lost. As most Twinkly effects are easily describable via some sort of YAML structure, this makes
it very easy to define the that way, so recreation of your effects become somehow easier.

Very sad that export/import of Twinkly effects is not (yet) possible via the app.  One only can hope...

You'll find 2 files in this repo at this moment:

* twinkly.yaml: the main file with the description of each of my custom effects
* devices.yaml: all my Twinkly devices with their corresponding playlist
